# gym-attitudecontrol
my custom OpenAI gym env for my attitude control research


## Install:

clone the repo wherever you want with
```
git clone https://github.com/jakeelkins/gym-attitudecontrol.git
```
then cd into the directory
```
cd gym-attitudecontrol
```
and
```
pip install -e .
```
might work just if you do 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/jakeelkins/gym-attitudecontrol.git
```
still trying to figure out this install thing
